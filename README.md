## Introduction<hr>

Hi! I am Antony, this web application is my portfolio project. This is a MVP with a few important features implemented, with More [features](https://github.com/users/SmitnAntonyDv/projects/1) to come in the future.

## About<hr>

Have a free day while tracking through Bali? Check posts made by other backpackers on **Explore Hidden Gems** and discover beautifull locations you could visit near you.<br>
Planning your backpacktrip in Vietnam and need some inspiration? Check some posts to find some locations you want to visit during your trip.
<br>

**Explore Hidden Gems** is dedicated to backpackers, who want to share and explore locations off the beaten track.<br>

The App's main concept is to be a platform where Users can view and/or post Must-visit locations. The app offers GPS functionality, a rating system, sorting based on distance between users and suggested location and more.

The app is dynamic and designed for tablet and PC (mobile version coming soon)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
